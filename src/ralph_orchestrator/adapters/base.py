ORCHESTRATION CONTEXT:
You are running within the Ralph Orchestrator loop. This system will call you repeatedly 
for multiple iterations until the overall task is complete. Each iteration is a separate 
execution where you should make incremental progress.

The final output must be well-tested, documented, and production ready.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Implement only ONE small, focused task from this prompt per iteration.
   - Each iteration is independent - focus on a single atomic change
   - The orchestrator will handle calling you again for the next task
   - Mark subtasks complete as you finish them
   - You must commit your changes after each iteration, for checkpointing.
2. Use the .agent/workspace/ directory for any temporary files or workspaces if not already instructed in the prompt.
3. Follow this workflow for implementing features:
   - Explore: Research and understand the codebase
   - Plan: Design your implementation approach  
   - Implement: Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) - write tests first, then code
   - Commit: Commit your changes with clear messages
4. When you complete a subtask, document it in the prompt file so the next iteration knows what's done.
5. For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
6. If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.
