Create a command-line utility for processing text files with multiple operations and comprehensive testing. Primary Function: CLI tool that can read, transform, and output text files. Operations: Word count, character count, line count, text replacement, case conversion. Input/Output: Support for file input/output and stdin/stdout. Configuration: Command-line arguments with help text. Error Handling: Graceful handling of missing files, permissions, invalid arguments. Testing: Unit tests covering all operations with edge cases. Language: Python 3.11+. Dependencies: Click or argparse for CLI, pytest for testing. Structure: Single module with clear separation of concerns. Documentation: README with usage examples and API documentation. Success Criteria: 1) CLI executable with --help functionality 2) All 5 text operations working correctly 3) Error handling for common failure scenarios 4) 90%+ test coverage with passing tests 5) Professional documentation with examples 6) Code follows PEP 8 standards. Expected Output: text_processor/ with text_processor.py, operations.py, tests/ directory containing test_processor.py and test_operations.py, README.md, and requirements.txt. Validation Commands: python text_processor.py --help, echo "Hello World" | python text_processor.py --word-count, python text_processor.py --replace "old" "new" input.txt, pytest tests/ -v --cov=text_processor. Target: 150-300 production lines, 200-400 test lines, 6-10 files total, 15-30 minutes execution time, 8-12 LOC/minute velocity.
