Build a RESTful API for task management with user authentication, database persistence, and comprehensive testing. API Endpoints: CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete). Authentication: JWT-based user authentication and authorization. Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for task and user data. Features: Task filtering, sorting, status updates, due dates. Validation: Request/response validation with proper error codes. Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, API endpoint tests. Framework: FastAPI or Flask with modern Python patterns. Database: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for simplicity. Authentication: JWT tokens with password hashing. Validation: Pydantic models for request/response validation. Documentation: Auto-generated API docs. Testing: pytest with test database and API testing. Success Criteria: 1) Working API server with all CRUD endpoints 2) User registration and JWT authentication 3) Database persistence with proper migrations 4) Comprehensive input validation and error handling 5) API documentation accessible at /docs 6) 85%+ test coverage with passing integration tests 7) Professional project structure and documentation. Expected Output: task_api/ with main.py, models/ directory containing user.py and task.py, routers/ directory with auth.py and tasks.py, database.py, auth.py, tests/ directory with test_auth.py, test_tasks.py, and conftest.py, README.md, and requirements.txt. Validation Commands: uvicorn main:app --reload, curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/register" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"test","password":"test123"}', curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/docs", pytest tests/ -v --cov=task_api. Target: 400-800 production lines, 500-1000 test lines, 12-20 files total, 30-45 minutes execution time, 12-18 LOC/minute velocity.
