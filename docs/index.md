## What is Ralph Orchestrator?

Ralph Orchestrator is a production-ready implementation of the **Ralph Wiggum orchestration technique** - a simple yet powerful pattern for autonomous AI task completion. It continuously runs an AI agent against a prompt file until the task is marked as complete or limits are reached.

Based on the technique by [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/), this implementation provides enterprise-grade safety, monitoring, and cost controls suitable for production environments.

## Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **🤖 Multi-Agent Support**  
  Works seamlessly with Claude, Q Chat, and Gemini CLI tools with automatic detection

- **💰 Cost Management**  
  Real-time token tracking, cost calculation, and configurable spending limits

- **🔒 Enterprise Security**  
  Input sanitization, command injection prevention, and path traversal protection

- **📊 Production Monitoring**  
  System metrics, performance tracking, and detailed JSON exports

- **🔄 Resilient Execution**  
  Automatic retries, circuit breakers, and state persistence

- **💾 Git Checkpointing**  
  Version control integration for state recovery and history tracking

## Quick Example

```bash
# 1. Create a task prompt
cat > PROMPT.md << EOF
Create a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence.
Include proper documentation and unit tests.
The orchestrator will iterate until the function is complete.
EOF

# 2. Run Ralph
python ralph_orchestrator.py --prompt PROMPT.md

# 3. Ralph iterates until the task is done!
```

## Why Ralph Orchestrator?

### The Problem
Modern AI agents are powerful but require supervision. They can lose context, make mistakes, or need multiple iterations to complete complex tasks. Manual supervision is time-consuming and error-prone.

### The Solution
Ralph Orchestrator automates the iteration loop while maintaining safety and control:

- **Autonomous Operation**: Set it and forget it - Ralph handles the iterations
- **Safety First**: Built-in limits prevent runaway costs and infinite loops
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested with comprehensive error handling
- **Observable**: Detailed metrics and logging for debugging and optimization
- **Recoverable**: Checkpoint system allows resuming from any point

## Use Cases

Ralph Orchestrator excels at:

- **Code Generation**: Building features, fixing bugs, writing tests
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive docs, API references, tutorials
- **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines, data analysis, report generation
- **Automation**: CI/CD setup, deployment scripts, infrastructure as code
- **Research**: Information gathering, summarization, analysis
