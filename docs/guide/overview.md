# Overview

## What is Ralph Orchestrator?

Ralph Orchestrator is a production-ready implementation of the Ralph Wiggum orchestration technique for AI agents. It provides a robust framework for running AI agents in a continuous loop until a task is completed, with enterprise-grade safety, monitoring, and cost controls.

The system is named after Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, embodying the philosophy of persistent iteration: "Me fail English? That's unpossible!" - just keep trying until you succeed.

## Key Concepts

### The Ralph Wiggum Technique

The Ralph Wiggum technique is a simple yet powerful approach to AI orchestration:

1. **Give the AI a task** via a prompt file
2. **Let it iterate** continuously on the problem
3. **Monitor progress** through checkpoints and metrics
4. **Stop when complete** or when limits are reached

This approach leverages the AI's ability to self-correct and improve through multiple iterations, similar to how humans refine their work through multiple drafts.

    H -->|No| B
    H -->|Yes| I[End]

    B --> K[Metrics]
    B --> L[Cost Control]
```

## How It Works

### 1. Initialization Phase

When you start Ralph Orchestrator, it:

- Validates the prompt file for security
- Detects available AI agents
- Sets up monitoring and metrics collection
- Creates working directories for checkpoints
- Initializes cost and token tracking

### 2. Iteration Loop

The main orchestration loop:

1. **Pre-flight checks**: Verify token/cost limits haven't been exceeded
2. **Context management**: Check if context window needs summarization
3. **Agent execution**: Run the selected AI agent with the prompt
4. **Response processing**: Capture and analyze the agent's output
5. **Metrics collection**: Track tokens, costs, and performance
6. **Progress evaluation**: Monitor progress towards objectives
7. **Checkpoint**: Save state at configured intervals
8. **Repeat**: Continue until task is complete or limits are reached

### 3. Safety Mechanisms

Multiple layers of protection ensure safe operation:

- **Input validation**: Sanitizes prompts to prevent injection attacks
- **Resource limits**: Enforces token, cost, and runtime boundaries
- **Context overflow**: Automatically summarizes when approaching limits
- **Graceful shutdown**: Handles interrupts and saves state
- **Error recovery**: Retries with exponential backoff

### 4. Completion

When the task completes or limits are reached:

- Final metrics are saved
- State is persisted for analysis
- Usage statistics are reported
- Detailed logs are exported
