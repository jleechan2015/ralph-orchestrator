- Created `app/models/category.py` - Category model with CategoryType enum (INCOME/EXPENSE)
- Created `app/models/transaction.py` - Transaction model with amount, description, and relationships
- Created `app/models/budget.py` - Budget model with BudgetPeriod enum (DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY/YEARLY)
- Set up Alembic for database migrations with proper configuration
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for all models (`tests/test_models.py`)
- Configured dual database support: PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for testing
- All tests passing (13/13 tests) with 94% code coverage

**Files Created:** 13 files (8 new + 5 Alembic)
**Lines of Code:** ~775 lines (including tests)
**Test Coverage:** 94% overall coverage

### Iteration 3 - Pydantic Schemas ✅
**Completed:** Implemented comprehensive Pydantic schemas for API validation:
- Created `app/schemas/base.py` with BaseSchema configuration and mixins (IDMixin, TimestampMixin)

- Created `app/schemas/category.py` - Category schemas with CategoryType enum and hex color validation
- Implemented `app/schemas/transaction.py` - Transaction schemas with amount/date validation and filtering
- Created `app/schemas/budget.py` - Budget schemas with BudgetPeriod enum and computed spending fields
- Added `app/schemas/common.py` - Common schemas for pagination, responses, and statistics
- All schemas include proper validation (email format, positive amounts, date ranges, color codes)
- Comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_schemas.py`) with 16 tests covering all schemas
