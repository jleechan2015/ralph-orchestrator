# Task: Create a Simple Calculator

Create a Python file called `calculator.py` that:
1. Has an `add` function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
2. Has a `subtract` function that takes two numbers and returns their difference  
3. Each function should have a proper docstring

Mark the task as complete when done.

## Solution

Created `calculator.py` with the following functions:
- `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers
- `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference of two numbers

Both functions include proper docstrings with descriptions, arguments, and return values.
