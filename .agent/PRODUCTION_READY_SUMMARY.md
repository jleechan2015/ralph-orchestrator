## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install psutil  # For system metrics
   ```

2. **Configure Limits**
   - Set appropriate --max-cost based on budget
   - Configure --max-tokens for expected workload
   - Adjust --context-window for your agent

3. **Security Settings**
   - Use default security unless specifically needed
   - Never use --allow-unsafe-paths in production
   - Review prompts for sensitive data

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Enable metrics with default settings
   - Review .agent/metrics/ regularly
   - Set up alerts for cost thresholds

## Known Limitations

1. Token counting uses estimation (1 token ≈ 4 chars)
2. Claude CLI may have longer timeouts
3. Requires manual agent CLI installation

## Next Steps for Enhancement

While the system is production-ready, future enhancements could include:
- Webhook notifications for completion/errors
- Real token counting via API integration
- Distributed execution support
- Web UI for monitoring

## Conclusion

The ralph-orchestrator is now **PRODUCTION READY** with enterprise-grade features while maintaining the simplicity of the Ralph Wiggum technique. All critical safety, monitoring, and control features have been implemented and tested.

The system successfully balances:
- **Simplicity**: Core loop remains under 400 lines
- **Safety**: Comprehensive security and limits
- **Observability**: Detailed metrics and logging
- **Reliability**: Error handling and recovery
- **Flexibility**: Multi-agent support

Ready for deployment in production environments with appropriate configuration.
