# Ralph Orchestrator Improvements Log

## Date: 2025-09-07

### Improvements Made

1. **Fixed Q Chat Adapter**
   - Enhanced prompt construction to explicitly tell q chat to edit the prompt file
   - Added `--trust-all-tools` flag to allow file operations
   - Pass prompt_file parameter from orchestrator to adapters
   - Clear instructions for adding TASK_COMPLETE marker
   - Result: Q chat now successfully completes tasks and modifies files

2. **Fixed Claude Adapter**
   - Similar enhancements to Claude adapter for consistency
   - Explicit file editing instructions in the prompt
   - Always use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for automation
   - Pass current working directory to subprocess
   - Result: Claude also successfully completes tasks and modifies files

3. **Core Orchestrator Enhancement**
   - Updated `_execute_iteration` to pass prompt_file parameter to all adapters
   - This allows adapters to know which file to edit
   - Consistent interface across all tool adapters

### Test Results

- ✅ Q Chat Integration: Successfully tested with factorial function task
- ✅ Claude Integration: Successfully tested with string reversal task
- Both tools now properly:
  - Read the task from the prompt file
  - Execute the requested work
  - Edit the file to add their solution
  - Add the TASK_COMPLETE marker

### Architecture Improvements

The adapter pattern is working well with these changes:
- Each adapter can customize how it constructs prompts for its specific tool
- The orchestrator provides consistent context (prompt_file) to all adapters
- Fallback mechanism remains intact for tool switching

### Next Steps

1. Test with more complex multi-step tasks
2. Add Gemini adapter when available
3. Implement better error recovery for failed tool executions
4. Add support for custom agents and profiles
5. Enhance metrics collection and reporting
