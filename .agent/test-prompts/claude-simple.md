# Task: Create Division Function

Write a Python function called `divide` that:
1. Takes two numbers as arguments
2. Returns the result of dividing the first by the second
3. Handles division by zero gracefully

Save it to a file called `divide_result.py`.

When you're done, add the text "TASK_COMPLETE" to this prompt file.
