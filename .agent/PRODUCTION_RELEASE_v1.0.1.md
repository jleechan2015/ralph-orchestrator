3. **Improved security validation patterns** - Eliminated false positives from markdown code formatting
4. **Enhanced command validation logic** - Better distinction between content arguments and shell commands

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 18/18 passing (test_production_readiness.py)
- **Integration Tests**: 17/17 passing (test_comprehensive.py)
- **Agent Compatibility**: Verified with Claude, Q Chat, and Gemini

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure at least one AI agent is installed:
which claude   # Claude CLI
which q        # Q Chat
which gemini   # Gemini CLI
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Auto-detect agent and run task
./ralph_orchestrator.py --prompt PROMPT.md

# Use specific agent
./ralph_orchestrator.py --agent claude --prompt task.md

# Production configuration with limits
./ralph_orchestrator.py \
  --agent claude \
  --prompt production_task.md \
  --max-iterations 100 \
  --max-runtime 14400 \
  --max-tokens 1000000 \
  --max-cost 50.0
```

### Monitoring
- Check `.agent/metrics/` for usage statistics
- Review `.agent/prompts/` for archived prompts
- Monitor logs for errors and warnings

## Known Limitations

1. Token counting is approximate (1 token ≈ 4 characters)
2. Claude CLI may experience timeouts on large responses
3. Context summarization relies on agent capabilities

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Startup Time**: < 1 second
- **Iteration Overhead**: < 0.5 seconds  
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB baseline
- **Test Suite Execution**: < 1 second
