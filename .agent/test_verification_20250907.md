## Test Coverage

### Features Verified
1. ✅ Tool adapter initialization
2. ✅ Command execution via subprocess
3. ✅ Response parsing
4. ✅ Cost tracking
5. ✅ Task completion detection
6. ✅ Metrics collection
7. ✅ Safety guards (iteration limits)
8. ✅ Multi-tool support
9. ✅ Error handling
10. ✅ Context management

### Test Files Created
- `test_q_simple.py` - Basic Q Chat functionality test
- `test_claude_simple.py` - Basic Claude functionality test
- `test_orchestrator_full.py` - Comprehensive orchestrator test with both tools

## Configuration Verified

### Q Chat (`q` command)
- Location: `/home/mobrienv/.local/bin/q`
- Syntax: `q chat @prompt_file` or `q chat "prompt"`
- Model: claude-sonnet-4

### Claude CLI
- Location: `/home/mobrienv/.npm-global/bin/claude`
- Syntax: `claude -p "prompt"`
- Authentication: Working (OAuth configured)

## Implementation Status

The Ralph Orchestrator is fully functional and tested with both primary tools:
- Core Ralph Wiggum loop implemented
- Adapter pattern for tool abstraction
- Comprehensive safety and metrics tracking
- Ready for production use

## Recommendations

1. The orchestrator is working as designed
2. Both q chat and claude integrations are stable
3. The system can handle task completion detection properly
4. Cost tracking is operational for monitoring usage

## Next Steps

- System is ready for production use
- Can be extended with additional tool adapters as needed
- Gemini adapter skeleton is ready for implementation when CLI is available
