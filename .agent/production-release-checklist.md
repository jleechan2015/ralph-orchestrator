## Production Deployment Steps üöÄ

1. **Fix Critical Issues**
   ```bash
   # Priority: Task completion detection
   # Update ralph_orchestrator.py with improved detection
   ```

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   python test_comprehensive.py -v
   python test_integration.py -v
   ```

3. **Verify Agent Configurations**
   ```bash
   ./ralph status
   which claude && claude --version
   which q && q --version
   ```

4. **Create Release Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Add release notes
   - Update version in README
   - Document known issues

## Post-Release Monitoring üìä

- [ ] Monitor GitHub issues for user reports
- [ ] Track successful deployments
- [ ] Gather feedback on agent compatibility
- [ ] Plan v1.1.0 improvements

## Current Status Assessment

### Ready for Production ‚úÖ
- Core orchestration loop
- State management
- Error recovery
- CLI interface
- Documentation

### Needs Work Before Release ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Task completion detection mechanism
- Agent trust configuration documentation
- Gemini compatibility (or removal)

### Nice to Have üí°
- Web UI for monitoring
- Advanced metrics collection
- Plugin system for custom agents
- Cloud deployment options

## Recommendation

**Status: NOT READY for production release**

The ralph-orchestrator is functionally complete but has a critical issue with task completion detection that needs to be resolved before production use. The agents are not modifying the prompt files as expected, which breaks the core loop termination logic.

### Next Steps:
1. Fix completion detection mechanism
2. Add agent configuration documentation
3. Run comprehensive end-to-end tests
4. Update documentation with solutions
5. Tag and release v1.0.0
