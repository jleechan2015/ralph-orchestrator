# Ralph Orchestrator Todo List

## Immediate Tasks âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Verify q chat integration works
- [x] Verify claude integration works  
- [x] Run integration tests
- [x] Document test results

## Current Implementation Status
The ralph-orchestrator is fully functional with:
- Core orchestration loop
- Q Chat adapter (tested and working)
- Claude adapter (tested and working)
- Gemini fallback support
- Git checkpointing
- Cost tracking
- Safety guards
- Context management

## Future Enhancements (from research)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add KV-cache utilization for context reuse
- [ ] Implement batch processing for parallel tasks
- [ ] Add streaming response handling for real-time feedback

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement event sourcing for full audit trail
- [ ] Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Create dashboard for metrics visualization
- [ ] Add webhook notifications for long-running tasks

### Production Hardening
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff strategies (optional mode)
- [ ] Add dead letter queue for failed iterations
- [ ] Create health check endpoints

### Context Management
- [ ] Implement context summarization for long sessions
- [ ] Add semantic chunking for better context windows
- [ ] Create context caching layer

### Integration Expansions  
- [ ] Add support for more CLI tools (aider, cursor, etc.)
- [ ] Create plugin architecture for custom adapters
- [ ] Add support for multi-agent orchestration

## Research-Based Improvements
Based on the comprehensive research in the parent directory:

1. **Simplicity First**: Current implementation follows this principle well
2. **Persistent Retry**: Core loop implements this effectively
3. **Context Accumulation**: Working, could be enhanced with summarization
4. **Cost Optimization**: Tracking works, could add predictive estimates
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: PROMPT.md pattern implements this

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration tests with mocked subprocess
- [x] Real q chat integration test
- [x] Real claude integration test
- [x] End-to-end orchestration test
- [ ] Load testing for long-running tasks
- [ ] Stress testing for error recovery

## Documentation
- [x] README.md exists
- [x] Implementation complete documentation
- [x] Test results documented
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guide for different use cases
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Notes
- Implementation is production-ready for basic use cases
- All core features from research are implemented
- System is extensible for future enhancements
- Following the Ralph philosophy: simple, persistent, effective
