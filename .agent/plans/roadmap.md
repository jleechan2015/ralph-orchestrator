# Ralph Orchestrator Development Roadmap

*Last Updated: 2025-09-07*

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development trajectory for Ralph Orchestrator, maintaining the core philosophy of simplicity while adding targeted improvements.

## Core Philosophy

**"Deterministically bad in an undeterministic world"**
- Keep the orchestration layer simple (< 500 lines)
- Delegate complexity to the AI agent
- Predictable failures are better than complex ones
- Fast iteration beats slow perfection

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE

### Week 1: Core Implementation
- [x] Basic orchestration loop
- [x] Claude integration
- [x] Q Chat integration
- [x] Gemini integration
- [x] Error recovery with circuit breakers
- [x] Git-based checkpointing

### Week 2: Essential Features
- [x] Token tracking and cost estimation
- [x] Basic safety rails (iteration limits)
- [x] Context management
- [x] Metrics collection
- [x] Multi-tool fallback support

## Phase 2: Intelligence Delegation (Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3: Smart Recovery
- [ ] Agent-driven error analysis
- [ ] Automatic recovery strategy selection

- [ ] Automatic context summarization
- [ ] Adaptive performance tuning
- [ ] Token usage optimization

## Phase 3: Production Hardening (Month 2)

### Week 5-6: Monitoring
- [ ] Real-time metrics dashboard

- [ ] Error rate tracking
- [ ] Success metrics

### Week 7-8: Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Chaos engineering tests
- [ ] Load testing

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Month 3)

### Distributed Execution
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination
- [ ] Parallel task execution
- [ ] Work queue management
- [ ] Result aggregation

### Enhanced Safety
- [ ] Semantic safety checks
- [ ] Resource usage limits
- [ ] Sandboxed execution
- [ ] Rollback automation

## Phase 5: Ecosystem (Months 4-6)

### Integrations
- [ ] GitHub Actions support
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines

### Community
- [ ] Open source release
- [ ] Documentation site
- [ ] Example repositories
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Community plugins

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: < 1s median, < 2.5s P95
- **Error Rate**: < 0.5%
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%
- **Cost Reduction**: 30-50% vs baseline

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: > 90%
- **Documentation**: 100% of public APIs
- **Response Time**: < 24h for critical issues
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.5/5 rating

## Implementation Principles

### Simplicity First
Every feature must:
1. Add clear value
2. Maintain simplicity
3. Delegate complexity to agents
4. Be measurable

### Incremental Improvement
- Small, frequent releases
- User feedback driven
- Data-informed decisions
- Continuous refinement

### Delegation Strategy
Complex logic goes to the agent:
```python
# Bad: Complex logic in orchestrator
def analyze_error(error):
    if isinstance(error, TimeoutError):
        if self.retry_count < 3:
            return "retry_with_backoff"
        else:
            return "fail"
    # More complex logic...

# Good: Delegate to agent
def analyze_error(error):
    return self.delegate_to_agent(
        "analyze_error_suggest_recovery",
        error=str(error),
        context=self.metrics.to_json()
    )
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity creep**: Regular code reviews, line count limits
- **Performance degradation**: Continuous benchmarking
- **Cost overruns**: Budget alerts, usage caps

### Operational Risks
- **Agent failures**: Multi-tool fallback
- **Data loss**: Git checkpointing
- **Infinite loops**: Iteration limits

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Implement stable prompt caching
2. Add context summarization
3. Enhance error recovery delegation

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. Build metrics dashboard
2. Expand test coverage
3. Document best practices

### Long Term (3-6 Months)
1. Open source release
2. Community building
3. Enterprise features
