- [ ] Implement better streaming output handling for Q Chat
- [ ] Add support for custom model selection via command line

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Implement distributed orchestration across multiple machines
- [ ] Add support for additional LLM providers (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.)

## üìù Documentation Needs

- [ ] Create detailed API documentation
- [ ] Add more example prompts and use cases
- [ ] Write deployment guide for production use
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## üß™ Testing Improvements

- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create stress tests for long-running tasks
- [ ] Add tests for error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Implement continuous integration pipeline

## Notes

The orchestrator is fully functional with both Q Chat and Claude. The implementation follows the Ralph Wiggum philosophy perfectly - simple, persistent, and effective. The core loop is under 400 lines as intended, delegating all intelligence to the AI agents themselves.
