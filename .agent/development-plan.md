# Ralph Orchestrator Development Plan

## Project Overview

The Ralph Orchestrator is a production-ready implementation of the Ralph Wiggum technique for autonomous AI agent orchestration. It provides a simple, persistent loop system that continuously attempts tasks until success.

## Current Status (2025-09-07)

### ✅ Completed

1. **Core Orchestration Loop**
   - Simple main loop (<400 lines)
   - Circuit breaker pattern
   - Exponential backoff retry
   - Graceful shutdown
   - Git checkpointing

2. **Multi-Tool Support**
   - Claude CLI adapter (tested)
   - Q Chat adapter (tested)
   - Gemini adapter (implemented, untested)
   - Automatic fallback mechanism
   - Common adapter interface

3. **Safety & Recovery**
   - Iteration limits
   - Runtime limits
   - Cost tracking
   - State recovery
   - Prompt archiving

4. **Testing**
   - Basic integration tests
   - Tool availability checks
   - Simple task execution
   - Multi-iteration support
   - Error recovery testing

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error messages
- [ ] Implement prompt validation before execution
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running tasks
- [ ] Create prompt templates for common tasks
- [ ] Add resumption from checkpoints

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Web UI for monitoring
- [ ] Multiple prompt queue support
- [ ] Parallel tool execution
- [ ] Advanced cost estimation
- [ ] Plugin system for custom tools

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- [ ] Distributed execution
- [ ] Database for metrics storage
- [ ] API endpoints for remote control
- [ ] Advanced scheduling
- [ ] Team collaboration features

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Core loop must stay simple
   - Complexity delegated to AI agents
   - Clear failure modes

2. **Fail Predictably**
   - Better to fail clearly than mysteriously
   - All errors logged and recoverable
   - State always persisted

3. **Tool Agnostic**
   - Support any CLI-based AI tool
   - Easy to add new adapters
   - Graceful fallback between tools

4. **Production Ready**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Metric collection
   - Cost controls
   - Safety limits

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Adapter initialization
- Safety guard limits
- Metric collection
- Context extraction

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end task execution
- Multi-tool fallback
- Error recovery
- State persistence

### Performance Tests
- Token usage optimization
- Execution time benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Cost tracking accuracy

## Known Issues

1. **Gemini Adapter**: Not tested due to CLI availability
2. **Windows Support**: Untested on Windows systems
3. **Large Prompts**: May need chunking for very large contexts
4. **Concurrent Execution**: Single-threaded currently

## Development Workflow

1. **Making Changes**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   
   # Make changes
   # Run tests
   python test_ralph_orchestrator.py
   
   # Commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add my feature"
   ```

2. **Testing New Adapters**
   ```python
   # Test adapter availability
   from ralph_orchestrator.adapters.my_adapter import MyAdapter
   adapter = MyAdapter()
   print(f"Available: {adapter.available}")
   ```

3. **Running Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   # Full test suite
   python test_ralph_orchestrator.py
   
   # Specific tool test
   python run_ralph.py --tool mytool --dry-run
   ```

## Research Integration

This implementation incorporates key findings from the comprehensive research:
