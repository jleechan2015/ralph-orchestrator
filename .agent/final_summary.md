# Ralph Orchestrator - Implementation Complete

## Summary

The Ralph Orchestrator has been successfully implemented and tested with both **q chat** and **claude** CLI tools. The orchestrator implements the Ralph Wiggum technique with proper file editing, task completion detection, and multi-tool support.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Core Implementation ✅
- Fully functional orchestration loop
- Adapter pattern for multiple CLI tools
- Context management and summarization
- Safety limits and cost tracking
- Git-based checkpointing

### 2. Tool Integrations ✅
- **Q Chat**: Working with file editing capabilities
- **Claude**: Working with file editing capabilities
- **Gemini**: Adapter ready (awaiting CLI availability)

### 3. Testing Results ✅
- **Real Integration Tests**: PASSED
  - Q Chat integration: ✓
  - Claude integration: ✓
  - Full orchestrator: ✓
- **End-to-End Test**: PASSED
  - Successfully creates calculator module
  - Completes tasks autonomously
  - Properly marks tasks as complete

## How to Use

### With Q Chat:
```bash
uv run python run_ralph.py --tool qchat --prompt PROMPT.md
```

### With Claude:
```bash
uv run python run_ralph.py --tool claude --prompt PROMPT.md
```

### With custom settings:
```bash
uv run python run_ralph.py \
  --tool qchat \
  --max-iterations 50 \
  --track-costs \
  --max-cost 5.00 \
  --checkpoint-interval 10
```

## Task Completion

To mark a task complete, add one of these markers on its own line in the prompt file:
- `TASK_COMPLETE`
- `**TASK_COMPLETE**`
- `- [x] TASK_COMPLETE`

## Version 1.1.0 Features

- Enhanced prompt construction for both q chat and Claude
- Explicit file editing instructions
- Proper passing of prompt file paths to adapters
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Cost tracking and safety limits
- Git checkpointing for rollback capability

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and production-ready. Future enhancements could include:
1. Adding more CLI tool adapters
2. Implementing advanced error recovery strategies
3. Adding a web UI for monitoring
4. Implementing distributed orchestration
5. Adding custom agent profiles

## Verification
