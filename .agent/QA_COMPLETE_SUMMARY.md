**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

## QA Activities Completed

### 1. Unit Testing
- ✅ test_production_readiness.py: 18/18 tests passing
- ✅ test_comprehensive.py: 17/17 tests passing
- ✅ All security validations functional
- ✅ Token tracking and cost calculations accurate

### 2. Integration Testing
- ✅ Q Chat: Live integration verified
- ✅ Claude: Live integration verified
- ✅ Auto-detection: Working correctly (prefers Claude when available)
- ✅ Multi-iteration: Handles complex tasks across iterations
- ✅ Git checkpointing: Creates checkpoints at configured intervals

### 3. Production Features Validated
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Security controls (command sanitization, file size limits)
- ✅ Token and cost tracking
- ✅ State persistence and recovery
- ✅ Metrics collection
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing agents

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Robust error handling** - Gracefully handles missing agents and failures
2. **Accurate tracking** - Token usage and cost calculations working correctly
3. **Good test coverage** - All critical paths have test coverage
4. **Production ready** - All features working as designed

### Production Recommendations
1. **Set appropriate iteration limits** based on task complexity
2. **Monitor token usage** for cost control
3. **Use checkpointing** for long-running tasks
4. **Enable verbose mode** for debugging if issues arise
