## Usage Instructions

The orchestrator is ready for immediate use:

```bash
# With Q Chat (fast, free)
uv run python -m ralph_orchestrator --tool qchat --prompt PROMPT.md

# With Claude (powerful, cost-aware)
uv run python -m ralph_orchestrator --tool claude --prompt PROMPT.md

# With safety limits
uv run python -m ralph_orchestrator \
  --max-iterations 50 \
  --max-cost 1.00 \
  --track-costs
```

## Technical Specifications Met

✅ Simple orchestration loop under 400 lines
✅ Delegated intelligence to AI agents
✅ Deterministic error handling
✅ Environmental validation through tests
✅ Cost tracking and safety limits
✅ Comprehensive logging and metrics
✅ Git-based checkpointing
✅ Multi-tool fallback support

## Conclusion

The Ralph Orchestrator fully implements the "Ralph Wiggum" technique as specified in the research materials. It provides a simple yet effective orchestration layer that embraces the philosophy of "I'm helping!" by delegating complex reasoning to AI agents while maintaining deterministic control flow.

The system is production-ready and has been successfully tested with the required CLI tools.
