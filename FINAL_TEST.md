# Final Integration Test

Create a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of a number.

Save it to `factorial_calc.py`.

The function should be named `factorial` and handle edge cases (0, negative numbers).

Add a test to verify factorial(5) = 120.

## Solution

Created `factorial_calc.py` with:
- `factorial(n)` function that handles negative numbers (raises ValueError) and zero (returns 1)
- Iterative calculation for positive numbers
- Test assertion that factorial(5) = 120
