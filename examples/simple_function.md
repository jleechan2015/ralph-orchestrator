# Simple Function Example

Write a Python function that:
1. Takes a list of numbers as input
2. Returns the mean, median, and mode
3. Handles edge cases (empty list, single element)
4. Includes docstring with examples

Save the function in statistics_helper.py

Add unit tests in test_statistics_helper.py

The orchestrator will continue iterations until the function is implemented and tested
