# CLI Tool Example

Create a Python CLI tool for file organization:

## Requirements

1. Command-line interface using argparse
2. Commands:
   - `organize photos` - Organize photos by date taken
   - `organize documents` - Sort documents by type
   - `organize downloads` - Clean up downloads folder
   - `organize --custom <pattern>` - Custom organization rules

3. Features:
   - Dry-run mode to preview changes
   - Undo functionality
   - Progress bar for large operations
   - Configuration file support (~/.file_organizer.yml)
   - Logging to file

4. Organization rules:
   - Photos: Year/Month folders based on EXIF data
   - Documents: Folders by extension (pdf/, docx/, txt/)
   - Downloads: Archive old files, group by type
   - Custom: User-defined patterns

5. Safety:
   - Never delete files
   - Create backups before moving
   - Handle duplicate filenames
   - Preserve file permissions

Save as file_organizer.py with supporting modules:
- organizers/photo_organizer.py
- organizers/document_organizer.py
- utils/config.py
- utils/backup.py

Include requirements.txt with dependencies

When complete, mark this task as TASK_COMPLETE
